# Aspects of Nature

summary:

- story & roleplay focused
- rules lite
- low math (ideally)
- flexible
- setting: cute anime characters with animal ears who can bend elements, low tech but with a modern day contemporary fantasy vibe

## Game Flow

Players should first create their characters, assigning attributes, aspects, and traits that suit them.

The narrator (called the game master or dungeon master in other systems) should prepare a scenario for the players to play through, whether it’s a single-session one-shot, or a campaign spanning over dozens of sessions. Sessions can last anywhere around 1 to 3 hours, depending on the energy levels, attention span, and/or available time for those playing.

The game starts and runs as a back-and-forth between players and the narrator

Example player actions:

- Look around for something interesting
- Take a closer look at something specific
- Charm or threaten an NPC
- Attempt to attack someone
- Dodge an attack

Example narrator responses:

- Describe the look and feel of the current scene, anyone that might be around, as well as any items of interest
- Ask for an attribute check to determine if a character succeeds on their action
- Play the part of an NPC, narrating their actions and voicing their dialogue

## Characters

Define the following for your character:

- Name
- Attribute values: give each one a score from 1 to 6, and they should add to 18
- Traits: choose three
- Aspects: choose one or more and assign 6 points among them. to each aspect, add your character’s value for that aspect’s related attribute
- Talents: pick one

Other values:

- Hits: starts at 0
- Toughness: equals strength + agility
- Fatigue: starts at 0
- Resolve: equals sense + intellect + wit
- Comeback: starts at 0

## Attributes

Characters have a number in each attribute from 1 to 6, all adding to 18

- Intellect: breadth of knowledge and how to apply it
- Sense: strength of mind, ability to focus and perceive
- Agility: nimbleness, adaptability, swiftness, acrobatic ability
- Strength: physical prowess, strength of body
- Wit: social skills, insight, manipulation, stealth, slight of hand

## Traits

Each player character picks three traits for their character to have, and each trait specifies two related attributes which:

- Adds a power die to rolls made with that attribute
- Lets you pick a proficient skill for that attribute

For example, let's say you give your character a long tail. This means that all Sense skills and all Agility skill checks will receive +1 power die. Then you can pick a proficient skill from each of those categories, let's say Listen from Sense, and Dash from Agility. Your Listen and Dash checks both now have +2 power dice.

The traits can come in whatever form you choose. For example, a tail could be long and thick like a lizard’s, or thin with a spaded tip like a devil's. You can add any number of additional traits beyond the first three for narrative flavor, even ones from this list, while specifying the ones that apply their attribute buffs.

Long Tail

- Sense: an additional appendage for sensory information
- Agility: helps with balance and quick direction changes

Fins

- Agility: streamlined movement
- Sense: sensitive to water pressure and movement

Wings

- Agility: aerial maneuverability
- Intellect: complex navigation and wind reading

Horns/antlers

Antennas

- Intellect: process complex sensory information
- Sense: detect subtle environmental changes

Furred ears

## Hits & Toughness

- Hits represent how many blows you’ve taken.
- Toughness is the number of hits you can take.
- Once your hits reach your toughness, you go down.
- While down, you can’t make any actions.
- Your hits cannot exceed your toughness.
- Once your hits are healed, you are no longer down.
- After combat, if you are down, you may attempt to succeed a Focus or Endurance skill check to heal 1 hit.

## Fatigue & Resolve

- Aspect art and other special actions require taking fatigue
- You can only take up to your resolve, then you can no longer use abilities that require taking fatigue
- 1 fatigue: for aspect art
- 2 fatigue: to reroll a die (only once)
- 2 fatigue: for an additional combat action (once per round)

## Resting

- Resting allows you to heal hits and fatigue, one each per in-game hour.

## Actions

Actions are the player's primary medium of interaction

Some actions may require a dice roll, such as a skill check or an aspect check, which determines how well you do.

### Attacks

Attacks are a specific kind of action with the intent to damage another character. With the appropriate justification, they can be made with any skill. Successful attack checks will deal either 1 hit or 1 fatigue, depending on the manner of attack. For example, physical attacks like Strike or Shoot would deal 1 hit. Scaring someone into a corner or weakening their morale would deal 1 fatigue.

## Comeback

Players earn 1 comeback point when failing a roll. They can spend any number of them to reduce a roll’s result. They cannot use a comeback point on the same roll that gave it to them. Comeback points return to 0 at the end of a session.

## Skills

Skill checks:

- Roll a d6, represents the difficult of the task
- Success = equal or less than the character’s value in that skill
- On a failure, you earn one comeback point

Power & risk dice:

- Added to skill checks via effects or situationally by the narrator
- Power die: subtracts from the roll
- Risk die: adds to the roll
- d6, where:
  - 1-3 = nothing
  - 4-5 = adds or subtracts 1
  - 6 = adds or subtracts 2
- Can add any number of them to a roll

Proficient skills:

- Determined by your trait attributes
- Gives +1 power die for skill checks made with that skill (_on top of_ trait bonuses)
- Proficient skills must be unique; cannot make a skill proficient twice

Strength

- Strike
- Block
- Throw
- Lift
- Endure

Intellect

- Intuit
- Recall
- Aid
- Operate
- Tinker

Agility

- Dash
- Jump
- Climb
- Dodge
- Maneuver

Wit

- Intimidate
- Deceive
- Read
- Sneak

Sense

## Combat

- combat starts when a character acts adversarially against another (such as, but not limited to, making an attack)
- to determine action order, everyone rolls a d6 and adds their choice of Agility (moving quick) or Wit (thinking quick), then every round resolves effects from highest to lowest
- one action per round
- every round, every participant chooses their action and their targets (if any) in secret
- once everyone has written down their action, reveal actions once by one in initiative order, making any necessary rolls at the time of revealing them
- a combat round lasts 5 seconds - for actions that specify "this round", they will last for 5 seconds out of combat

## Talents

> WIP

## Luck

To determine the outcome of things outside of player's control, players or the narrator may make a luck roll. Luck rolls are made with a d12, treating the result as a gradient from one possibility to another.

Example: a character needs to catch a train to work.

- 12: their path is completely clear
- 9: they got momentarily stopped by a cat along the way
- 6: construction required them to take a different route, but they know the city well enough for that to not be a problem
- 3: it seems like the whole world doesn't want you to get to that train! they'll need to pass several skill checks to make it on time
- 1: the train itself got delayed; they'll be late no matter what
