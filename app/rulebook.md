# Aspects of Nature

summary:

- story & roleplay focused
- rules lite
- low math (ideally)
- flexible
- setting: cute anime characters with animal ears who can bend elements, low tech but with a modern day contemporary fantasy vibe

## Game Flow

Players should first create their characters, assigning attributes, aspects, and lineages that suit them.

The narrator (called the game master or dungeon master in other systems) should prepare a scenario for the players to play through, whether it’s a single-session one-shot, or a campaign spanning over dozens of sessions. Sessions can last anywhere around 1 to 3 hours, depending on the energy levels, attention span, and/or available time for those playing.

The game starts and runs as a back-and-forth between players and the narrator

Example player actions:

- Look around for something interesting
- Take a closer look at something specific
- Charm or threaten an NPC
- Attempt to attack someone
- Dodge an attack

Example narrator responses:

- Describe the look and feel of the current scene, anyone that might be around, as well as any items of interest
- Ask for an attribute check to determine if a character succeeds on their action
- Play the part of an NPC, narrating their actions and voicing their dialogue

## Characters

Define the following for your character:

- Name
- Attribute values: give each one a score from 1 to 6, and they should add to 18
- Traits: choose three
- Aspects: choose one or more and assign 6 points among them. to each aspect, add your character’s value for that aspect’s related attribute
- Talents: pick one

Other values:

- Hits: starts at 0
- Toughness: equals strength + agility
- Resolve: equals sense + intellect + wit
- Comeback: starts at 0

## Attributes

Characters have a number in each attribute from 1 to 6, all adding to 18

- Intellect: breadth of knowledge and how to apply it
- Sense: strength of mind, ability to focus and perceive
- Agility: nimbleness, adaptability, swiftness, acrobatic ability
- Strength: physical prowess, strength of body
- Wit: social skills, insight, manipulation, stealth, slight of hand

## Traits

The following is a list of traits you can add to your character, as well as the attribute bonuses they give. They can come in whatever form you choose. For example, a tail could be long and thick like a lizard’s, or thin with a spaded tip, like that of a devil. You can add any number of additional traits beyond the first three for narrative flavor, even ones from this list, but you have to choose which give your character their mechanical benefit.
