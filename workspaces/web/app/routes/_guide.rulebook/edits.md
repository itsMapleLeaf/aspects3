[x] You may want to bold or italicize "Aspects of Nature" where it is mentioned (twice).
[x] Hyperlinks to level section are broken
[x] Sounds good to keep attributes/attunement separate. Maybe just clean up where attunement is explained because the formatting there is a bit rough.
[x] "depending on the energy levels, attention span, and/or available time for those playing" - this feels unnecessary/obvious
[x] "a general north star that guides their decisions", this wording feels awkward
[x] checks mentioned before explained

Narrator
[x] this section mentions game mechanics and lore (skill checks, power dice, risk dice, aspect crystals) that have not been explained yet
[x] 'diagetically' (typo for 'diegetically') is jargon, audience unfamiliar with literary analysis might not know this term

Character Creation
[x] under Resting, the word 'removing' might be better than 'recovering'

Aspects
[x] I would put the bulleted list immediately after the first line
[x] it's unclear as written if the risk die applies to all unattuned aspects or only major ones

Action Rolls
[x] "has some chance of failure" - also flip side, some chance of success, no rolling for things that are clearly impossible
[x] roll under - might be easier to digest it if framed as, your score needs to be higher than the roll (especially if the narrator is the one to roll, because then you are trying "beat" the narrator's roll)

Zones
[x] 2D, so how is the vertical axis handled? When a plane flies directly overhead, is it in my immediate zone and I can strike it?
[x] "A character's range affects their action rolls in the following ways:" the bullets under this are difficult to parse, perhaps you could bold the actions and/or reformat a bit

[ ] re: Adrenaline. The fact that this section comes after Action Phase makes it feel to me like it's an afterthought. Maybe put Adrenaline and Movement before Action Phase to make it clear that these need to be set during Decision Phase? (Also, does the player decide the order of their actions and movement during decision phase or can that be changed during Action Phase? If I had chosen Strike and Move but the opponent went first and moved out of striking distance, could I do Move then Strike?)

## big

[ ] what is meant by a "back-and-forth" between players and narrative? Is it real-time or turn-based or something else?

[ ] re: scenarios. Yeah, the writing feels like it is aimed at people who may not have played TTRPGs before. I was almost expecting to see a section on "Scenario" with some probing questions for the narrator to think about when creating the scenario.

[ ] There is nothing in the rules about how NPCs work. Is an NPC character sheet the same as a PC character sheet? During combat decision phase, does the narrator also secretly choose the NPC actions?

[ ] Death saves are possible. Given the anime theme, maybe some kind of "spirit actions" for players who are down? Again, I haven't played it so I don't know how bad it feels to go down (maybe it's rare and brief and not an issue), but I just know being told I can't do anything makes me disengage from a game, and I don't think you want any players to feel that (even if that feeling is somewhat normalized in TTRPGs).

[ ] re: Initiative. Oh! I forgot sometimes you might want to be later in an initiative. Yeah, I'd actually suggest making that explicit in the rules like "Hint: You may want to choose your lower score..." That way players know that choice is in their hands and isn't just an automatic thing (even if 99% of the time they'll just choose the higher one), and so players might second-guess minmaxing those two stats (aka giving themselves no control over where they go in initiative order).

[ ] re: Movement. Yeah, it doesn't need to be super detailed, but just some sort of acknowledgment that barriers and terrain may impede movement or require specific traits.

[ ] I think at some point you could include some example pre-generated characters in the rulebook for new players/narrators to run.

[ ] I'm not a fan of players being sidelined when their characters are down unless they aren't down for long or have a chance to get back up

[ ] Even-numbered levels don't do anything? (fixed when adding talents at every even level)

## traits:

- [ ] cover all attribute combinations
- [ ] format like a table
- [ ] remove "A proficient skill gives you an additional power die." and explain skill proficiencies under "Skill checks" instead
