# TypeScript / JavaScript

Always include the file extension in imports, e.g. `import { a } from './a.ts` (or `tsx` if it's a tsx file)

# Tailwind CSS

- Don't use `dark:` variants for styling; this app is dark mode only
- Include `transition` for classes with hover/active/focus states
- Prefer using `size-*` classes instead of `w-* h-*`

# React component files

For files with multiple components, put the exported components first before the internal children components. For example:

```ts
export function Parent() {}

function Child() {}

function OtherChild() {}
```
